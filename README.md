 This is a fun challenge given by my mentor to practice webdevelopment skills
 Exercise to consider a website and find a feature which can be added
 code the feature in react
 I chose target website and noticed that it does not have that message box or chat bot
 This repo creates a messagebox and opensup 2 minutes after page load and also has the option to click a button to open the messagebox
